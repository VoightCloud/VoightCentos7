To make this work locally, you'll need to change some urls and addresses.
### CREATE A NEW BRANCH!

* In template.json replace the voight.org iso with the following:
https://mirror.umd.edu/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-2009.iso

### Unless you plan on running packer, you don't need the rest.
* In requiredsoftware.yaml replace the voight.org link with the following:
https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/releases/download/v0.1.53/scap-security-guide-0.1.53.zip
